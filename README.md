Model tuning, ML pipeline and Hyperparameter tuning 
•	The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall maintenance cost.
•	Finally, hyperparameter tuned XGboost model on under sampled data was selected as the best model. Then the related pipeline is generated and used for production.
